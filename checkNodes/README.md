# Check Nodes Example

## Overview

This diagnostic tool evaluates the performance and connectivity of RPC nodes across different blockchain networks. It provides detailed timing and availability information for network endpoints.

## What This Example Shows

- **Network connectivity testing and performance benchmarking** - Implementing systematic testing of RPC endpoints to measure response times and reliability
- **Working with multiple RPC endpoints and measuring response times** - Handling concurrent connections to various blockchain providers and collecting performance metrics
- **Building diagnostic tools for blockchain infrastructure monitoring** - Creating comprehensive monitoring solutions for production blockchain applications
- **Handling network timeouts and error conditions gracefully** - Implementing robust error handling for unreliable network conditions and node failures
- **Creating detailed performance reports with tabular data formatting** - Generating professional reports that help teams make informed decisions about infrastructure
- **Understanding RPC node reliability patterns across different chains** - Learning how different blockchain networks and providers perform under various conditions

## Installation

```bash
cd examples/checkNodes
go mod tidy
go build
```

## Usage

```bash
./checkNodes [--verbose]
```

## Key Concepts

This example is particularly useful for:

- DevOps engineers managing blockchain infrastructure
- Developers choosing between RPC providers
- Building monitoring systems for blockchain applications
- Troubleshooting connectivity issues with blockchain nodes

The implementation demonstrates practical patterns for building robust blockchain applications that can handle network instability and provider failures.
